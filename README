INTRO
This module adds a 'quote' link below nodes and comments. When clicked, the body of the source node
is copied to the comment body with special formatting such that it is clear that
the author is quoting from the source node. The module also features a optional filter
which encloses the quoted material in [quote] tags, hiding the raw markup from end users.

THEMEING
- you may redefine the quote-author and quote-msg css classes if you wish
