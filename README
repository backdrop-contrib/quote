INTRO
This module adds a 'quote' link below nodes. When clicked, the body of the source node
is copied to the comment body with special formatting such that it is clear that
the author is quoting from the source node.

TODO
- rework comment.module so this works for comment replies as well

THEMEING
- you may redefine the quote-author and quote-msg css classes if you wish
